# Earthquake-map
Earthquake Map is an application that displays an interactive map of the world's earthquakes and enables the user to visualize the threat some cities face.

DISCLAIMER: the "threat circle" radius is for illustration purposes only and is not intended to be used for safety-critical or predictive applications.

The UI is a PApplet (Processing window) that displays the National Geographic world map provided by Esri alongside the map's legend.
As the user hovers the over a city or earthquake, a pop-up appears with information about the location.
